        <h2 class="navigation"><strong>A landmark in Munich - and beyond</strong></h2>
      <p class="navigation"><strong>With the monumental Olympiastadion reaching the end of its shelf life, tenants Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich were left with a decision: renovate the 30-year-old structure or build a new home.<br />
            <br />
        They opted for the latter course and, in October 2002 work commenced on a plush new stadium in the north of the Bavarian capital. Just under three years later, in May 2005, an arena was officially unveiled which also boasts one of Europe's biggest parking lots and has become the envy of the continent.<br />
        <br />
        The blueprint was for a pure footballing theatre which would attract visitors even when a ball is not being kicked. The project was a resounding success. All of Bayern's home Bundesliga fixtures since the stadium opened have been sold out, with over three million guests visiting the stadium in the Fr&ouml;ttmaning district each year. 700,000 sausages were swallowed, 30,000 hectolitres of beer consumed and 1,200 people employed during the first year of the Allianz Arena's existence alone.<br />
        <br />
        The atmosphere generated nowadays is also a major improvement on the largely open-air Olympiastadion, with the absence of a tartan track bringing the fans closer to the action. It was not long before the capacity of 60,000 was deemed too small. Seating areas were transformed into terracing and rows of business seats converted into normal ones, allowing for an increase in capacity to 69,901.<br />
        <br />
        That is still nowhere near enough to satisfy Bayern's demands given the constant scramble for tickets. The 2012 Champions League final saw over one million requests for tickets received and, while tenants Bayern were admittedly involved in that one, demand would have massively outstripped supply regardless - such is the lure of an innovative arena which has become a beacon of the Munich skyline at night, thanks to its unique illuminated exterior.</strong></p></td>
